<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Welcome to my homepage! I am Shenwei Hu (ËÉ°Ê∑±Â®Å), currently pursuing a Master's degree at Tsinghua University. My focus lies in the areas of Binary Translation, RISC-V  Toolchain, and Compiler development, with guidance provided by the supervisors at <a href='https://www.rioslab.org/'>RISC-V International Open-Source (RIOS) Lab</a>. I am a member of the <a href="https://github.com/orgs/riscv-admin/teams/riscv-devpartner-partners">RISC-V Technical Members</a> and actively involved in developing innovative solutions to bridge the gap of building RISC-V economy.

I look forward to sharing my latest findings and contributing to the advancement of the field through my work. Feel free to explore my projects and reach out to me if you'd like to connect and chat more about them!

**I am currently seeking opportunities to pursue a Ph.D. program starting in Fall 2025.**

# üíª Projects 

- **An Intelligent Binary Translation Framework (Master Research Topic)**

    - A binary translation tool aims at automatically learning instruction rules between assembly and LLVM IR, and translating guest binaries to host. Including preprocess, learning, verification and translation parts. 

- **Automatic Test Generator for RISC-V Vector Extension (Open-source Project)**

    - Collaborated with RISC-V International to develop the first test generator capable of providing self-checking and compliance tests with quantitative coverage reports across numerous mixed configurations in RVV.
